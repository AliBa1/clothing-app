# Streetwear Marketplace Application

## What is this?

An application that makes it easier to buy and sell clothes. For smaller, independent brands they will be able to get more eyes on their stuff from their target audience. Their discoverability and audience retention will skyrocket since people will be able to find them without sole depending on buyinug ads. For users they will have a better experience finding exactly what they want from a wide range of options.

## Where is it at right now?

Currently I am working on creating a mock frontend so that I have an idea of what all the functional requirements will be before creating the database and backend.

## Future Plans

Once I finish the mock frontend I want to create the REST API and database so that it can evolve into a mobile app as well

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React, Playwright
- **Backend:** Go
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## Run Frontend
